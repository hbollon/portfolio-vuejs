## How to edit content
This template have a CMS support with CosmicJS.
You can easily put your content there by creating and linking your cosmicJS account. To do this, you just have to modify the variables contained in the ENV file (API token, bucket slug and read key).

```env
# CosmicJS 
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_TOKEN=" "
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_BUCKET_SLUG=" "
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_BUCKET_READ_KEY=" "
```

Of course, you will also have to create your content on your CosmicJS bucket (be careful to respect the slugs that I use if you do not want to have to adapt the code, I will do a tutorial but in the meantime do not hesitate to open issues if you have a problem :) )
