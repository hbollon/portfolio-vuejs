## How to edit content

This template has a CMS using CosmicJS. You can easily put your content there by creating and linking your CosmicJS account.

In order to customize your portfolio, you must create a CosmicJS account and a new fresh bucket on it. Once done, you must update credentials of the **.env** file.

To do this, you just have to modify the variables contained in the ENV file (API token, bucket slug and read key).

```env
# CosmicJS
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_TOKEN=" "
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_BUCKET_SLUG=" "
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_BUCKET_READ_KEY=" "
```

After that, you need to create the object type and data we will use. To do that properly and easily, you can import the json file, located [inside the data folder of this repo](https://github.com/hbollon/portfolio-vuejs/blob/master/data/portfolio-vuejs_import.json), by accessing import/export settings inside your bucket settings page.

Now, you can customize it with your data through CosmicJS interface!
